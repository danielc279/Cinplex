Following the destruction of the Kragle, Finn&#039;s sister Bianca has been invited to share their father&#039;s LEGO collection; in the LEGO universe, this is represented by the arrival of Duplo aliens. Emmet builds the aliens a heart as a token of friendship, but when one eats it and playfully demands more, Lucy interprets this as an attack and retaliates. The Duplo creatures cry and invade, making a mess of Bricksburg. President Business unhelpfully tells everyone to &quot;get along&quot; before leaving to go golfing, but Emmet tells Lucy that &quot;Everything can still be awesome&quot;.
