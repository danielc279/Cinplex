Three weeks have passed since the kidnapping of three young girls orchestrated by Kevin Wendell Crumb, who has been dubbed "the Horde” by the media due to his dissociative identity disorder which produced two dozen identities. One of the girls was Casey Cooke, who survived an attack from one of Kevin's personalities, "the Beast,” who allowed her to escape because she was “pure” and had experienced suffering at the hands of a sexually abusive uncle.
